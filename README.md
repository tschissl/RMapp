R Shiny app for reference material data presentation

A standalone interactive web app built with the SHINY “R” CRAN
package allows users to create plots with mass fractions and/or
isotope ratios. The app is hosted by the International Association of
Geoanalysts (IAG) and is accessible through the following link:
https://geoanalyst.shinyapps.io/PGE_lit/. The current version allows
the selection of PGE data of 53 RM (sediments, mafic and ultramafic
rocks). Data are presented as boxplots of mass fractions versus data
source (laboratory) sorted by increasing lab median. Data tables are
also downloadable. Further developments will permit the calculation
of modes, medians and means and the presentation of best robust
estimates of true values with their associated uncertainties.

Suggestions for modications, changes, additions are welcome.
